# public class Stack<T>
A stack is a data structure that stores a list of elements, with two principal operations:push, which adds an element to the top of the stack, and pop, which removes the element from the top of the stack.

## ` void __init__()`


## ` void __destroy__()`


## ` void push(T? value)`
Pushes a value onto the stack.

## ` T? pop()`
Pops a value off the stack. Returns the value at the top of the stack. Removes the value from the stack.

## ` T? peek()`
Peeks at the top of the stack. Returns the value at the top of the stack. Does not remove the value.

## ` bool isEmpty()`
Returns true if the stack is empty.

## ` int size()`
Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## ` void clear()`
